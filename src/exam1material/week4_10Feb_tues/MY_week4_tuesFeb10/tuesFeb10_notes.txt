HW 3 due tonight

    #5: p ∨ q ∨ r ⊢ r ∨ q ∨ p

    What will the structure be?

    what is the top level op? 
    p ∨ q ∨ r: top level is the rightmost or 
    (p ∨ q) ∨ r

    Try OrE on premise 
    SugbProof: assume p v q 

    goal: r v q v p 
    top-level is the rightmost Or 
    could introduce OR if have r v q 
        or if I had p 

        nested OrE
        SubProof: assume P 
        goal: r v q v p 

        SubProof: Assume q 
        goal: r v q v p 
        first get r v q 
        then get r v q v p
         
    How to build conclusion?

Exam 1 review.

Covers everything we've done up to this point 
(including today).


See Canvas announcement for list of topics.




How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1:

    Approach 2:




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?




What is satisfiability? 



- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)
    valid: 

    how prove valid?

    how prove invalid?


/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
